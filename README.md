# Generative AI
![topic](images/QA_retriever_pipeline.png)
We will cover series of generative ai tasks which include but not limited to:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM Page Summarization
- Retrieval-based Chatbots
- so on...

## Tasks
<details>
<summary markdown="span"><h3>Retrieval Augmented Generation with LLM Part 1</h3></summary>

RAG is a process of fetching up to date or context specific data from an external database and making it available to to an LLM when asking it to generate a response.  

To be able to do this, we need an open source language model, a vector database and a composer. Fortunately, there are freely available open source python libraries to create this solution. For simplicity, we will use the following:

* Pre-trained T5 model from Huggingface as LLM
* ChromaDB as vector database 
* Langchain as application tools.

<summary markdown="span"><h3>Retrieval Augmented Generation with LLM Part 2</h3></summary>
Instead of using a pre-trained T5 model, we will use gpt4all models.

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><h3>LLM Page Summarization</h3></summary>
To summarize a page, we will use a GPT4All as LLM.
